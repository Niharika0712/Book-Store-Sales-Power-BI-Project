# Book-Store-Sales-Power-BI-Project
The dataset consists of books sold in various categories with associated prices, quantities, and customer ratings. I designed this dashboard to help answer key business questions like:

Which book categories are performing best in terms of quantity sold?

How does pricing vary by category?

Whatâ€™s the distribution of customer star ratings?

Is there any correlation between star rating and sales?
